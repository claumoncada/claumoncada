            "\n",
            "2. **Restart your laptop and router/modem:**\n",
            "   - Sometimes simply rebooting your devices resolves connectivity issues.\n",
            "   - Turn off your laptop, unplug your router and modem from power for about 30 seconds, then plug them back in.\n",

            "4. **Check for airplane mode and network issues:**\n",
            "   - Ensure your laptop is not in Airplane mode (found in network settings).\n",
